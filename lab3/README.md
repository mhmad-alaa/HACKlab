# **Stored Procedure**

### Procedures in sql server can be called *unscientifically* the **sql functions**

### Scientifically is the set of logical group of SQL statements which are grouped to perform a specific task.

Procedures benefits:
- Simplify repeated tasks
- Run Faster
    - Stored procedures are cached on the server
- Reduce network traffic
- Help to provide security
    - Limit direct access to tables via defined roles in the database
- Errors can be handled in procedure code without being passed directly to client applications.
- Protecting against some SQL injection attacks.
- Stored procedures can be written once and accessed by many applications.

  Proceddures processing if we can say it's not an iterative 
  process across it's requirements in the database system.

  That mean you need to create a table first and somehow 
  make the proceddures out of the transactions queries.

  That mean you can't use an online compiler which process 
  all in one file like a script.
