# **Stored Procedure**

### Procedures in sql server can be called *unscientifically* the **sql functions**

### Scientifically is the set of logical group of SQL statements which are grouped to perform a specific task.

Procedures benefits:
- Simplify repeated tasks
- Run Faster
    - Stored procedures are cached on the server
- Reduce network traffic
- Help to provide security
    - Limit direct access to tables via defined roles in the database
- Errors can be handled in procedure code without being passed directly to client applications.
- Protecting against some SQL injection attacks.
- Stored procedures can be written once and accessed by many applications.

  Proceddures processing if we can say it's not an iterative 
  process across it's requirements in the database system.

  That mean you need to create a table first and somehow 
  make the proceddures out of the transactions queries.

  That mean you can't use an online compiler which process 
  all in one file like a script.

There are differneces between procedures in many things like

- Default Parameter
    - you can specifiy a values as the default or not

- Optional Parameter â€“ NULL Parameter
    - if you don't pass the value it set the default,
        the default may be null
- Output Parameter
    - it's the returned value from the procedure
    - it defined in the procedure parameters with <output>
        and with Execute code wiht <output> to 
- Return Values
    - it's mostly like the Output Parameter, 
        but they differ in some criterias witll shown.
```

|**Return Value** | **Output Parameters** |
|:--------|:-----------:|
| Only Integer Datatype | Any Datatype|
| Only one value returned | More than one value returned|
| Use to convy sucess to failure| Use to return values like id, name, count|
